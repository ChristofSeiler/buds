Description: BUDS is an rstan based package for recovering latent ordering 
    of observations. A Bayesian model is fitted to the pairwise dissimilarities 
    between datapoints to recover the latent 1D coordinates for the datapoints
    along an underlying data trajectory. These 1D coordinates can be used to
    obtain the hidden order the observations.
